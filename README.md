# PA4
Implementing concepts of Inheritance and dynamically created objects in c++
The assignment provides a header and .cpp file to use as parent class.
The next step is to derive the manager class from the employee class.
After creation of base class, the calcPay function is redefined and all function definitions are put in the .cpp implementation file.
Main function starts with object creation.
A conditon for an error code if manager number exceeds 100 is put in place as well. 
User input prompts are set up and data is subsequently stored.
Conditions and calculations for highest paid manager is done next.
Then, after all compilation and calculations, average pay is displayed along with highest earner.
Deallocation and then end of code.
